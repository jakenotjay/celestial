# Celestial #
Celestial is a Physics simulation of N-Body gravitational motion. 

### Summary ####

* N Body Problem.py is the simulation code, simply run this in the console after defining BCs and it will produce a graph and mp4
* animation.py is a selection of animations and plots for a binary file that is defined in the running
* BCs.py is a list of boundary conditions which can be copy and pasted into N Body Problem.py to run a given simulation
